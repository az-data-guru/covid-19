# covid-19 Arizona Data
This is a frequently updated dataset of how Coronavirus and COVID-19 are impacting Arizona and its fifteen counties. The data is curated from two separate sources: The Arizona Department of Health daily coronavirus reporting site as well as press releases and reporting from Arizona's 15 counties, as well as the Navajo Nation.

The sets break down as follows:

az_counties.csv

Data collected from county reporting. Where county reporting was not available at the time, days were filled in by taking data from the New York Times covid reporting project found here. https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data.
## April 16,20120 Update
County Reporting and AZDHS reporting has now been merged. When reporting is not in sync, the higher number is taken.

az_counties_hospitalized.csv 
County reports of hospitalizations in Arizona due to COVID-19. Many hospitals are just beginning to report hospitalizations to the county health departments as of April 6, 2020 so this dataset will not seem as complete as the az_counties.csv cases dataset. Where counties broke down hospitalizations by age, the dataset does so as well.

navajo_nation_coivid.csv
COVID-19 case and death counts for the Navajo Nation. The Nation does not disclose the locations of deaths so it is one column. This project is Arizona centric so counties outside of Arizona have been combined.

az_zip_codes.csv
AZDHS Zip code file with additional fields added by ABC 15.

This project is attributable to ABC 15 Phoenix.
